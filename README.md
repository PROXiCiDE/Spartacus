## Background Information
 Back in 2017 I started development on a Quest Editor for Project Celeste as a hobby, due to technical difficulties of a over 10 year old computer. Hardware fail and i lost everything. This caused a lot of lack in motivation to get my foot back in the door. Last year i had an accident which has caused me to go back and forth to hospital.
